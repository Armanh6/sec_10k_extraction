This project uses the SEC website and api to scrape data straight from the 10-K filings of a company (which are its yearly financial reports). I wanted to do this as if you Google information about a company, you get various contradictory data. This data comes straight from the SEC website and from a company's 10-K filings. At first, I used https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/CIK{number}.json to scrape data however, the company facts section stores data from all years for a company, causing the file to be too large to process and scrape, and I could not get it to be accurate, so I switched tactics. I first get the CIK number from https://www.sec.gov/files/company_tickers.json then I use that to search the company’s submission for its 10-K filings through https://data.sec.gov/submissions/CIK{cik}.json then finally I scrape data from https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/{cik_int}/{acc_no}/{filename}. For my Enhanced model, I added some modeling and turned it into an Excel file. My Enhanced model can calculate a DCF, give you a market cap for a price, or vise versa. All of the companies metrics can be verified manually buy going to its 10-k filings and taking a look manually at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/{cik_int}/{acc_no}/
